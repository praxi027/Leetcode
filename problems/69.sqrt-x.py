#
# Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to
# the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.
# 
# You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.
# 
# 
# For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: x = 4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: x = 8
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down
# to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
# 
#
