# Testcase Example:  '[1,1,2]'
#
# Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each
# element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,1,2]
# Output: [1,2]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
# Output: [1,2,3]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
# The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
# 
# 
#

# @lc code=start

#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
